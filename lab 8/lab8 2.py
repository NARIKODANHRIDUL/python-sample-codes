#  Function in Python is defined by the "def" statement
# followed by the function name and parentheses "()"
# paretheses may or may not include values. After
# parentheses a colon should be given and the code
# should be given under the function defenition with
# proper indentation
# Example: 

def func1():    #function defenition
    print("I am learning Python function") # code

# The output of the function will be :
# "I am learning Python function"
