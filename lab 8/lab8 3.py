#  Function Call:- A function is the simplest callable
# object in Python. if a function has to be executed
# it has to called. its using the function name along with
# parentheses(arguments inside parentheses to send some
# values to the function), we call the function.

# for example:

def add(a,b):
    print a+b
a,b=3,4
add(a,b)    #This is the function call
